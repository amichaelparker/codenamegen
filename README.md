# codenamegen

This is a continuation of the other code name project I made found [here](https://github.com/amichaelparker/codenames).

This version uses *request* and *cheerio* to grab and scrape the Intel code names [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_codenames),
and *express* and *ejs* for web deployment and testing. It is an idea I got from one of [@mpjme's](https://twitter.com/mpjme) 
amazing [funfunfunction](https://www.youtube.com/c/mpjmevideos) videos.

This version requires you to have node installed, and can either be deployed as an app, or run 
from the command line by typing `npm start` in the working directory.

The deployed app can be found at [Heroku](https://codenamegen.herokuapp.com).
